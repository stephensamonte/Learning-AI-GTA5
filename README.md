# Learning-AI-GTA5

GTA 5 is the closest simulation of living life. The end goal of this project is to create a general AI that understands its surroundings and can made decisions on its own.

Disclaimer: I don't expect to succeed at creating a general AI. I do expect to create a program that can play GTA 5 well. I think it will be a mash up of multiple AIs. 

# Current Goals: 
- Capture the screen with OpenCV in python 
- Create functions to call Keyboard interaction

# Environment 
We are making changes to this project on a windows machine and are running GTA 5 baught from Steam for $30.00. [Steam GTA 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/). This program will is being edited in the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) set up for [python development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). Here is a [tutorial for python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial). 

Optional: You may install GTA 5 mods to have God mode control over the Game Environment. 

# How to Set Up Mods for GTA 5 
The purpose of mods is to beable to control the environment. I added 2 Tesla Car mods and sort of God Mode mod which allows me to control the traffic, weather, spawn cars, etc. I made this for others who wish add mods: [2018.12.24 How to Install GTA 5 Mods]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k3z26HRxOlJ-v-ALhVgJuAP70ht3Ny2YI8Lj5H43o_I/edit?usp=sharing)
