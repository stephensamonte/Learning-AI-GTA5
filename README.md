# Learning-AI-GTA5

GTA 5 is the closest simulation of living life. The end goal of this project is to create a general AI that understands its surroundings and can made decisions on its own.

Disclaimer: I don't expect to succeed at creating a general AI. I do expect to create a program that can learn with experience and play GTA 5 well.
